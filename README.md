### husband, engineer, veteran

Currently at Workiva where I use Go, Java and Dart to build beautiful, reusable product experiences that our customers love.

Graduating in May 2021 from Arizona State with a Computer Science degree. Previously at Mailchimp, NASA/ASU Space Grant and US Navy.

I ❤️ cycling, hiking, reading, and spending time with my wife, Samaura.

Oh, and I also love plants and my dog, Karina. (Not in that order)
